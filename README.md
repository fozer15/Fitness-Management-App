# Fitness Management App

I developed this app for my COMP 3005 (Database Management Systems) final project. It is built using **React, PostgreSQL, Material UI, Node, and TypeScript**. The application includes three account types: Admin, Manager, and Trainer, each with distinct roles and capabilities.

## Key Functionalities

- **Trainer Availability Management:**  
  Trainers can set and manage their available times.

- **Class and Trainer Assignment:**  
 Admins can perform all CRUD operations on the group classes and assign trainers to scheduled classes based on their availability.

- **User Scheduling:**  
  Users can enroll in group classes and schedule one-on-one sessions with trainers, aligning with the trainers' schedules.
